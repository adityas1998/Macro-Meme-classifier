# Macro-Meme-classifier

In this project I've used neural networks to classify images into memes. As of now this network can classify between macro(images with text on them) from any other image.

The first notebook is a sample classifier which differentiates between dog and cat images. This was used as the base to develop the macro/meme classifier.
